Const Keyword in Dart
The Const keyword in Dart behaves exactly like the final keyword.
The only difference between final and const is that the const makes the variable constant from compile-time only. 
Using const on an object, makes the objectâ€™s entire deep state strictly fixed at compile-time and that the object with this state will be considered frozen and completely immutable.
