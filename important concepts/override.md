Override
Overriding is an object-oriented programming feature that enables a child class to provide different implementation for a method that is already defined and/or implemented in its parent class or one of its parent classes.
Method overriding occurs in dart when a child class tries to override the parent class's method. When a child class extends a parent class, it gets full access to the methods of the parent class and thus it overrides the methods of the parent class.
