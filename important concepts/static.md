Dart â€“ Static Keyword

The static keyword is used for memory management of global data members. The static keyword can be applied to the fields and methods of a class. The static variables and methods are part of the class instead of a specific instance. 

The static keyword is used for a class-level variable and method that is the same for every instance of a class, this means if a data member is static, it can be accessed without creating an object.
The static keyword allows data members to persist Values between different instances of a class.
There is no need to create a class object to access a static variable or call a static method: simply put the class name before the static variable or method name to use them.
